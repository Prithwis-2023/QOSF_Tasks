## Files

The 2 files present in this repository together make up the solution of Task 3. The file **task3.py** implements the CCX and CCCX gates through the utilization of CX and U. In contrast, the file **multi_controlled_x.py** implements the code for a generic multi-controlled x gate, derived from the ground-breaking research by experts in this revolutionary field.
